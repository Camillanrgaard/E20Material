<!--The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. You can use <video> for audio content as well, but the <audio> element may provide a more appropriate user experience.  It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one:

<audio controls>
 <source src="foo.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus"/>
 <source src="foo.ogg" type="audio/ogg; codecs=vorbis"/>
 <source src="foo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>
</audio>
