    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I teach at Erhvervsakademi Aarhus. I currently have my primary work assignments in the Multimedia Designer education and teaching in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. Previously, I taught at our top-up programme in Digital Concept Development.</p>

    <p>What interests me is how technology can improve human living conditions, both in working life and in private life. In short: How can technology help make the world a better place to live? Identifying problems and testing technologies on reality and then communicating theories, methods and results is my passion.</p>
