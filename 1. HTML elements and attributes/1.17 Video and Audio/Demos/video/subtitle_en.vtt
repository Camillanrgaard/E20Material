I am going to give a brief introduction to checkboxes and radio buttons.

00:06.773 --> 00:12.522
And I've split the screen so I have brackets on the left

00:12.522 --> 00:15.644
and chrome to the right.

00:15.644 --> 00:23.390
And purely semantically, checkboxes and radio buttons are form elements.
