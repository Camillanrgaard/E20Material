    <p>Jingle Bells</p>
    <p>Dashing through the snow<br>
        On a one horse open sleigh<br>
        O'er the fields we go,<br>
        Laughing all the way<br>
        Bells on bob tail ring,<br>
        making spirits bright<br>
        What fun it is to laugh and sing<br>
        A sleighing song tonight</p>

<!--The <br> element has a single, well-defined purpose â€” to create a line break in a block of text. It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.-->
