<!--
The FOR attribute of <label> must be equal to the ID attribute of the related element to bind them together. .

Associating a <label> with an <input> element offers some major advantages:
1) The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it too. This means that, for example, a screenreader will read out the label when the user is focused on the form input, making it easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.

2) You can click the associated label to focus/activate the input, as well as the input itself. This increased hit area provides an advantage to anyone trying to activate the input, including those using a touch-screen device

The AUTOFOCUS attribute lets you specify that the element should automatically have input focus when the page loads. Only one form-associated element in a document can have this attribute specified.

The REQUIRED attribute lets you specify that user input are required before the form can be submitted.
