ABSOLUTE URL
This is the most straightforward, and is the only way to go if you want to link to an external image (an image hosted on another site).

Including an image from another website like this is sometimes called “hotlinking” or "deep linking".
If the image in question is under copyright, and you do not have permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws by hotlinking.-->
