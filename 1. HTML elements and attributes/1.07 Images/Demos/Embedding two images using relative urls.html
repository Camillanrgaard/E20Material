<!--
The src attribute is required, and contains the path (URL) to the image you want to embed.
An alt attribute's value should clearly and concisely describe the image's content. It should not describe the file name of the image.

RELATIVE URL
A relative URL does not include the domain name, and is relative to either the current page, or the current domain.
